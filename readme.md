This is a simple resource that allows players to start a vote to skip the night time in the game world and set the time to morning if enough players vote yes. The resource is designed to be self-contained and easy to use, without requiring any additional configuration or setup.

This resource is intended to be a basic implementation and is not actively maintained. However, the resource is open-source, and any pull requests to improve the code or add new features are welcome. At some point, an ESX implementation might be made, if anyone actually wants to use it.
